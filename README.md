# Introduction
As a teacher, I have to engage in parent-teacher conferences a few times a year and every year I found myself rushing to make a quick intro card so people can know my name once they enter my room or are speaking with me. Of course, I can introduce myself or - as I have done here - I can have a programmable e-ink screen displaying my name and relevant information for parents. This is super simple to do and setup, but I wanted to dedicate a repository for my own posterity.

# Case
This next section covers the 3D-printed case so I can put the badger on my desk.

The case I made has it as a slight angle and utilizes magnets to hold the cover in place. This makes it easy to take the Badger 2040 in and out of the case for changing what is displayed on the screen.

# Code
There is already a lot of available code, especially from Pimoroni themselves; I decided to take some of the available code and use ChatGPT to edit it.

## Software
I personally like to use Thonny for my editing/programming of microcontrollers, so that is what I have here.

# Tips
I have been using the filament I have here because it's just available. I think this would look better in black (Prusa has a really nice galaxy black filament).

I used gorilla glue to hold the magnets in place.
